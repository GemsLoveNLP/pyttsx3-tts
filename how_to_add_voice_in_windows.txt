1. Search the windows settings for "speech setting"
2. Scroll down to "Manage voices" and click the Add voices button
3. Select the language you want and press add to download, then restart the settings and the added voice should be listed under Installed voice packages
4. Try running print_index() to see if those voices had been added (In the case that it hadn't go to the rest of the steps, else yay you're done)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
5. Go to the windows search and search for Registry editor
6. Expand the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE folder
7. Exapnd the SOFTWARE folder
8. Expand the Microsoft folder
9. Expand both the Speech, Speech_OneCore folder (after this step do for both the folders)
10. Expand Voices
11. Expand Tokens
12. The voice you want should be in the Tokens folder of Speech_OneCore but not of Speech
13. Right click on the folder of the voice you wanted and select Export (preferably to desktop so we can edit it easily),(named it using the voice name for convenience)
14. Right click on the exported file (in my case it's in desktop) and choose Edit (If you're in windows 11 then click show more option first then edit)
15. Now it should be opened in a text editor
16. Click Edit button next to the File button
17. Click replace
18. Give the first slot "Speech_OneCore", and the second slot "Speech" (do not include the quote sign)
  - this step should change the file in such a way that the Speech_OneCore is changed to Speech
19. Save the file and exit the file
20. Run the file
21. Many windows will pop up to try and tell you that it's a bad idea, just ignore it and press okay till it's done
22. Check the Tokens folder under the Speech folder mentioned in step 12., the voice that we changed should now be added here
23. After this step, the voice should hopefully be added to your voices list in pyttsx3, you can check using the print_index() function
------------------------------------------------------------------
Additional Notes:
- The voice that are listed as something that is not English can read English poorly but can read out their own alphabet such as Pattara for Thai
- The voice I find most "Frenchy" is the voice named Sean (Ireland)
